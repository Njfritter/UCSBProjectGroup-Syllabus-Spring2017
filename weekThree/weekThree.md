## **Form Teams**
Talk about what you are looking to accomplish this quarter, for those of you who were already in a team from last quarter use things that you felt needed improvements as learning experiences. 

Key take aways:
+ De facto project leader
+ Organize time wisely
 	+ Have tangible goals every meeting 
	+ Be concrete in what you wish to accomplish every meeting time
	+ Implement **Stand Ups**

## Structure of an effective Stand Up:
+ What did I accomplish last meeting?
+ What will I do today?
+ What obstacles are impeding my progress? (Blockers)

## Good Team Work Ethics
Make note of attendance and make safety nets for days of absence (usually around midterm season)

Talk about:
+ Project Idea
+ Necessary steps needed if data set isn't readily available
	+ Do you have to *webscrape*? If so do you prior experience or anyone in your team.
+ Provide link for team members to be able to access the data set. 
+ Understand *GitHub* workflow, teach it to other teammates
	+ For more advanced users learn **git** workflow
+ *Virtual Environments*, again teach if other teammates
### Post Shit on Slack 
Any documentation which you think will help your other teammates get context
	+ Relevant articles about the data set
 	+ Published papers about data set
 	+ Documentation of *Algorithms* and implementation examples (online *Jupyter Notebooks*, *Kaggle* kernels, *r-blogger* article)
+ Documentation for the modules and packages most useful documentation available. 

+ Discuss weaknesses, technologies, expertise, talent
	+ Pick **R** or **Python**
	+ Discuss schedules
