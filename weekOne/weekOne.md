### FOR PAST MEMBERS 

**IMPORTANT TO NOTE**: After the first official meeting, April 12th, I would like for new teams to start, so after that meeting time will be spend recycling the format we start last quarter. 

This is basically saying:
+ Any work on previous projects has to be done **outside** the regular Wednesday meetings
+ Necessary because of the library showcasing and eventual publishing on *inertia7*
+ Talk to me or David if you are ready to start publishing
