## **Note for Last Quarter's Teams**
All work from last quarter must be *completed on own time*.  

## **Introductions**
We want to get to know you (we really do), but time constraints will limit how we do this. We will start with some preliminary logistics:

+ Introductions of facilitators for this quarter's **Project Group**
+ Explain structure of weekly meetings
+ Sign up for contact information [link here](https://goo.gl/forms/IwMgAP1w62fvIzmG3)
+ Create *GitHub* accounts, follow me. **Star** this repo, we will make everyone follow or star this shit no exceptions. 

## **README Introductions**
To get everyone involved and ready to start practicing documentation (super useful once you become a user on inertia7) we will do an activity that will help with those of you who are new, and make the more advanced members help out and do some pseudo-pair-programming. 

+ Read the template within this folder and do your best to follow along without looking at the source code. 
	+ Use a text editor of your choice (look at our resources folder in this repo to get some recommendations)
+ For those of you who are more advanced try to walk around and help those who are working on this
	+ Try to sit next to them and walk them through your understanding of markdown syntax including but not limited to; linking images, creating lists, headers, *italics*, etc 
+ As well as if you know markdown syntax pretty well and you have a project idea create a repo with your project idea to prepare for the next part of our meeting. 
+ Finally I want those who are more advanced to create a repo and explain branches while the n00bs create a branch in that repo to post their introductory README

## **Project Proposals**
Brainstorm on Project Ideas
+ Write them on a blank piece of paper/markdown file
+ Go in front of group and *sell* your idea
+ Have people walk up to you/walk up to people, **convince** people to be in your group

## **Form Teams**
Talk about what you are looking to accomplish this quarter, for those of you who were already in a team from last quarter use things that you felt needed improvements as learning experiences. 

Key take aways:
+ De facto project leader
+ Organize time wisely
 	+ Have tangible goals every meeting 
	+ Be concrete in what you wish to accomplish every meeting time
	+ Implement **Stand Ups** 
+ Make note of attendance and make safety nets for days of absence (usually around midterm season)

Talk about:
+ Project Idea
+ Necessary steps needed if data set isn't readily available
	+ Do you have to *webscrape*? If so do you prior experience or anyone in your team.
+ Provide link for team members to be able to access the data set. 
+ Understand *GitHub* workflow, teach it to other teammates
+ *Virtual Environments*, again teach if other teammates
+ Any documentation which you think will help your other teammates get context
	+ Relevant articles about the data set
 	+ Published papers about data set
 	+ Documentation of *Algorithms* and implementation examples (online *Jupyter Notebooks*, *Kaggle* kernels, *r-blogger* article)
+ Documentation for the modules and packages most useful documentation available. 

+ Discuss weaknesses, technologies, expertise, talent
	+ Pick **R** or **Python**
	+ Discuss schedules

Best way to learn is just by doing, and following by example. 

Those with more experience help teammates do the following:
+ Establish channels for communication:
	+ *Slack*
	+ *GitHub*
	+ *Phone*
	+ *Email*
	+ *GroupMe*
	+ *Facebook
